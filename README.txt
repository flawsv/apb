*** Important, please read before usage ***

1. These files are all (only on paper) against the APB Reloaded Terms of Service (ToS), as it states that players are not allowed to modify the game's files in any way. However, I've personally gone over every single file provided in this archive with Little Orbit staff and can confirm that none of these files can get you banned from the game at present time and they've permitted me to distribute them publicly. I would never knowingly release a file that can get your APB account suspended to the public. That being said - use any of these files at your own risk as I take absolutely no responsibility for any damage to your PC, your game or your account.

2. Make sure to create backups of the original files of anything you are replacing in case you want to revert any configs (at least ones I've not included vanilla files for). Otherwise you would need to repair/patch or even reinstall the entire game to obtain the original files for some of the files which don't always get replaced by vanilla files.

3. If you are going to use my localization as a base for your own stuff and/or modify it AND you plan to distribute it publicly to others, please make sure to at least credit me as the creator of the base for your localization. This only really goes for the localization as it is the only really unique part of this config.

More APB configs and mods (many of them probably obsolete as of APB 1.30 64-bit Upgrade and EAC re-implementation updates) @ https://apb.zone/ - much thanks to Tobii / TobiiDK / Nullzone

You can download the original modded files for APB from that link, make your own config or use them as they are.

For dummies: if you messed something up and would like to get everything back to vanilla to start over or anything else, simply open the regular APB launcher and let it re-download all the original files again. If something else is still messed up you can click "Options" in the regular APB launcher and "Repair" the game, you can re-install it entirely or ask someone for their file.


Make sure to report any bugs to me wherever you can contact me and I will do my best to fix them.
